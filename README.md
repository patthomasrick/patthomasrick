# Hi, I'm Patrick

I’m Patrick, a senior fullstack software engineer at Dr. Fit. I graduated from the University of Virginia’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in May of 2021 with bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Computer Engineering.

My favorite language is probably Python, and my favorite emoji is the monkey emoji.
